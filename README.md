Custom Printf Project Readme
The Custom Printf project aims to create a simplified version of the printf function in C. This project involves implementing a function that takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, formats them according to the format specifiers, and outputs the formatted string to the console or a specified output stream.

Project Overview
The printf function in the C standard library is a powerful tool for formatting and displaying text. This project aims to replicate some of its functionality by building a custom my_printf function. The basic idea is to iterate through the format string, identify format specifiers (e.g., %d, %s, %f), and replace them with the corresponding values.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Basic understanding of C programming.
A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
Project Structure
The project files might be organized as follows:

css
Copy code
custom_printf_project/
│   README.md
│   main.c
│   custom_printf.c
│   custom_printf.h
main.c: The main program where you demonstrate the usage of your custom my_printf function.
custom_printf.c: The source file where you will implement the my_printf function.
custom_printf.h: The header file containing function prototypes and necessary definitions.
Implementation Steps
Step 1: Parse Format String
Iterate through the format string character by character.
When encountering %, start parsing the format specifier.
Step 2: Handle Format Specifiers
Identify the format specifier (e.g., d for integers, s for strings, etc.).
Extract the corresponding argument from the argument list.
Format the argument according to the specifier.
Step 3: Output Formatted Text
Output the formatted text to the console or a specified output stream.
Usage
Include the custom_printf.h header in your main.c or any other source file where you want to use the my_printf function.
Call the my_printf function with a format string and the necessary arguments.
Examples
Here's a simple example of how the custom my_printf function can be used:

c
Copy code
#include "custom_printf.h"

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    char *text = "Hello, Custom Printf!";

    my_printf("This is a number: %d\n", num);
    my_printf("This is a string: %s\n", text);

    return 0;
}
